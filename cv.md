## About Me

### Novice frontend developer.

### Successfully completed courses at TeachMeSkills, as a graduation project I developed a clone of the Unsplash gallery (https://draenkov.github.io/unsplashClone/).

### I chose to change my specialization, because today the economist is a very unclaimed profession. All business processes are becoming automated and value of manual work is going down.

### Why did I choose frontend? Because it’s beautiful. I can’t draw, but I really enjoy watching and using at work awesome modern UIs and I think I have a sense of style.

### After the courses I continue self-education: improving my graduation project, watching interviews on youtube and learning algorithms

### In my free time I enjoy playing drums and doing sports (swimming, tennis, gym). It provides me with a good balance in my life.

### Non-conflict, well organized, having a rational view of things.

### Considering all offers, including internships and relocation.
